Hi Frank,

Been delayed in putting together stimuli for the verb-final expt, but
I've done a bit of corpus work and I wonder if we shouldn't change the
order of constituents a bit.  The main problem is that the Mittelfeld
order

  NP-acc (NP-dat) (PP) Adv V

seems to be pretty rare, at least in the Tiger corpus.  What if we
switched it up as follows:

  (PP) (NP-dat) NP-acc V

All the possible constituent orders from this are fairly common, and
there's the nice property that adding each optional constituent always
increases the conditional probability of V after the NP-acc.  This
would give us the following sample stimulus set:

  Er hat das Auto verkauft, und ...

  Er hat ohne jegliche Kenntnis seines defekten Motors das Auto
  verkauft, und ...

  Er hat dem freundlichen Nachbar meines fremden Verwandten das Auto
  verkauft, und ...

  Er hat ohne jegliche Kenntnis seines defekten Motors dem
  freundlichen Nachbar meines fremden Verwandten das Auto verkauft,
  und ...

Intuitively for you, is there still greater difficulty at "verkauft"
for the final sentence as compared to any of the other three?


Also, I've put together a proposed list of ditransitive verbs to work with;
they're at

  good-ditransitive-verbs

The first set is ones that appear as some nnV[A-Z]+ in Ulrike's file
at least three times; the second set is other verbs that I thought
might be good.  I marked some of them with question marks if I thought
that they might be bad to include because they're too rare, or because
perhaps the ditransitive use is too idiomatic, or for other reasons.
Take a look and see if there are any major modifications you'd
propose.  There are about 30+ verbs on the list, so hopefully this is
enough to construct a set of 24 lexicalizations...

Roger
